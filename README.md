A pragmatic Data Science Professional with an interest in different Data Science and Artificial Intelligence applications. Currently exploring different aspects of Data Science such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Exploratory Data Analysis, End - to - End ML Development. 

I have developed and deployed some beginner-level Data Science Applications. Such as Cyberbullying Tweet Recognition app and Fashion Image generation app. I always try to work on problems outside my scope of knowledge to expand my knowledge.

I have completed multiple online courses to gain the necessary skills for Data Science. Such as Google Data Analytics Specialization, Machine Learning Specialization, and Deep Learning Specialization. 

Some of the technologies I am familiar with are Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, Exploratory Data Analysis, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SpaCy, SciKit-Learn, Tensorflow, StreamLit, Git and GitHub, R, Tableau.
